# hello-world
First repository (through github guide)

Hii.. I'm still rarely using my english to communicate with others. 
Hopefully I can manage this thing ^^.

About my programming knowledge,
I started programming since junior high school.
Learning basic stuff like html, visual basic, c++, php, etc.
Yet I don't really understand those things.
I just understand like + - / * etc

2020, I focused to learn programming by myself.
I started with:
- imitated html css js stuff from youtube then create mine similar with what I had learnt
- reading 'python crash course' -> I learnt how to create game, create mine also.. I learnt also in web development using django.
- reading 'head first java' -> to learn more about OOP
- reading a bunch of javascript books, searching the best explaination so I can undertand deeply.
- reading many articles about MERN stack

All the stuff that I have done, I did many unfinished mini project which just to makes sure that I understand what I was doing.
